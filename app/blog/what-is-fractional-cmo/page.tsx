      <h2>Understanding the Fractional CMO Model</h2>
      <p>
        In today&apos;s competitive business landscape, many companies need senior-level marketing expertise but can&apos;t justify the cost of a full-time Chief Marketing Officer. This is where a <strong>Fractional CMO</strong> becomes invaluable.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A Fractional CMO is an experienced marketing executive who works with multiple clients, providing strategic marketing leadership at a fraction of the cost of a full-time hire. They bring C-suite level expertise, strategic thinking, and proven methodologies to help businesses accelerate growth.
      </p>

      <h2>How Does a Fractional CMO Work?</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional marketing consultants who focus on specific tactics, a Fractional CMO takes on the strategic leadership role that a full-time CMO would handle:

      <h2>When Should You Consider a Fractional CMO?</h2>
      <p>
        Fractional CMO services are ideal for businesses in several situations:
      </p>
      
      <h3>Startups and Growing Companies ($1M+ Targeted Annual Revenue)</h3>
      <p>
        Startups and companies with targeted annual revenue of $1M and above often need sophisticated marketing strategies but can&apos;t justify a $150K-$250K full-time CMO salary. A Fractional CMO provides the expertise starting from just $30K-$60K annually for 10-20 hours of engagement per month.
      </p>

      <h3>Marketing Transformation</h3>
      <p>
        When your business needs to scale marketing efforts, implement new technologies, or pivot strategies, a Fractional CMO brings the experience to navigate these changes successfully.
      </p>

      <h3>Gap Between Marketing Managers and CMO</h3>
      <p>
        Many businesses have marketing managers handling tactical execution but lack strategic leadership. A Fractional CMO bridges this gap without the commitment of a full-time hire.
      </p>
